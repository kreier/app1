# General Information for AP Physics 1

To allocate the number of lessons for each unit one can use the percentage given by college board for parts of the final exam. This is converted into a timeframe of 75 indivitual lessons, since the AP exam is written 5-6 weeks before the school year ends during exam week, so all teaching should be finished before that. With 2.5 days teaching per week the 180 days equal 90 teaching days. Minus 6 weeks some 75 days or lessons remain. Distributed by percentage gives:

| Topic                           | lessons | exam percent |
